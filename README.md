# raytracer project
A 3D optical ray tracer built using Python for 2nd year physics coding project. Refracts rays through spherical surfaces onto a screen. 


# Getting Started

To run any of the test scripts, first run the raytracer, optical_elements and plot modules:

raytracer.py: Module to describe optical rays and bundles
optical_elements.py: Module to describe optical elements, such as refracting surfaces, lenses and output planes
plot.py: Module for plotting spot diagrams and calculating rms spot radius from diagrams

Task/optimization scripts (each test script file contains grouped tasks for the project):

tests_tasks_1-8.py: test script to test tasks 1-8, up to propagation for a singular ray
tests_tasks_9-11.py: test script to test single spherical refracting surfaces and calculate paraxial focus
tests_tasks_12-14.py: test script to test a single spherical surface, beyond the paraxial limit, using a beam of rays
task_15_plano_convex.py: test script to model a plano-convex singlet lens in both orientations
lens_optimization.py: test script that optimises the design of a biconvex lens based on the orientation
		      of a plano-convex lens where the convex surface faces the input
